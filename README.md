# How to get the script
Method 1:  
In our [script](/script) folder you can find many scripts, you can copy or download them, but you can not edit or change them, if you edit them you will be violating the [MIT license](/LICENSE).  
  
Method 2:  
Find my account on [scriptblox](https://scriptblox.com/u/Tektronix). There are many scripts in it. You can copy them, but you cannot change or edit them, otherwise you will violate the [MIT license](/LICENSE) as in method 1.
